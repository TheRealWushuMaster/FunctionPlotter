# ðŸ“ˆ Function Plotter ðŸ“‰

This program will make a plot of an arbitrary input function.

## Instructions

To start, run `GUI.py`.

The steps for using it are:
1. Input an expression in the function entry (should contain the variable at least once, default value `x`)
2. Set the limits of the variable in the `Start` and `End` entries
3. Set the resolution (`Points per unit`)
4. Use the `Return` key or click the `Plot` button

## Input function
The program accepts regular mathematical functions from Python.

Additionally, it can use custom functions as defined in the `custom_functions.py` file.

The user can use `pi` and `e` as well.

## Controls
Using the toolbar, the user can zoom in/out and pan.

## Future features
1. Calculate the integral of the function by:
- Dragging the mouse over a range of values
- Inputting the range
2. Calculate the derivate on each point by dragging the mouse over the plot
